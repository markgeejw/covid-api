This is the API for the COVID-19 modelling web app from [here](https://github.com/markgeejw/covid-app).

## About the API
The API was developed using Flask and Flask-RESTful.

## How to run the API
The API is currently deployed to `http://api.covidmodelling.com/` but you can run a local version for testing.
1. In another terminal, navigate to the `covid-app` directory.
2. (Requires pipenv) Run `pipenv install` to install all dependencies. Alternatively, use pip to install from requirements.txt file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `pipenv run python index.py` to start the api (or whatever virtualenv manager you're using).


# API usage
The API is currently deployed using [Now](http://now.sh) with the URL `http://api.covidmodelling.com/`.

The API has three endpoints, `/model`, `/info`, `/case`.
### Model Endpoint
The endpoint `/model` is used to query the developed COVID-19 model. It requires the following query parameters:

| Key           | Expected length | Type                                                                  | Description                                                              | Format                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

\* These numbers are percentages and should be given in the % form, e.g. for 80%, use 80 instead of 0.8.

The model gives the as output `JSON`, with the keys `results` and `data`.

### State Info Endpoint
At the `info` endpoint, the API returns some useful information about the country/state. It requires the following query parameters:
| Key     | Description           |
|---------|-----------------------|
| country | Country to be queried |
| state*  | State to be queried   |

\* Optional. You can choose not to include state if querying for whole country, or for countries without states like Singapore.

The API returns the following state information:
| Key                   | Description                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| population            | Total population for country/state |

| icu beds              | Number of ICU beds                 |
| weekly hospital       | Number of weekly hospitalisations  |

### State Cases Endpoint
At the `case` endpoint, the API returns information regarding the number of COVID-19 cases. It requires the following query parameters:

| Key        | Description                         |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| country    | Country to be queried               |
| state*     | State to be queried                 |

| interval** | Interval between the cases reported |

\* Optional. You can choose not to include state if querying for whole country, or for countries without states like Singapore.
\** Optional. Defaults to 1 for daily cases.

The endpoint returns a single array stored in the key `cases`. The array contains the total cumulative number of cases at `start_date` at the first index. The subsequent indices contain the number of cases reported according to `interval`.
